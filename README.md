When I first started my website, which is based on an Online CV, I wanted a unique background. I thought of the London Bridge as this could represent where I am from. the first image I chose was quite small and, so it was going to be blurred if it was enlarged.
I then had to find another larger image, which is the current background now. Also, as the image was quite bright, some of the text was difficult to read. Therefore, I darkened the image, making the font stand out. ![background darkend](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25661816/33569928-26a964b8-d923-11e7-9009-9a30120320b1.jpg)

I managed to arrange chunks of text where I wanted, except the 'About Me' section which I can't get it to go to the centre.

Another issue was getting the sections for the years of university equal height.

When creating a slideshow, I chose a carousel effect without text. I added text so that people know the name of the places. However, every time the image changed, the text of that image will move itself at the top of the slideshow.
Here is an example:

I solved this problem by adding the text onto the image via photoshop.

During the html validation, an error came up saying '|' is an illegal character. However, this was part of the link. I solved this by googling a replacement for the illegal character, which was '%7c'.

A friend of mine explored my website and found an issue with the cv. When downloaded, it would not allow the him to open the cv as I did not have it saved in the folder. Therefore, I added a pdf version of my cv and added it in my
changes folder.

These are the sketches for my website. It will follow on in the second page as it could not fit on the paper:
