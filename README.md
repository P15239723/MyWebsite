When I first started my website, which is based on a Online CV, I wanted a unique background. I thought of the London Bridge as this could represent where I am from. the first image I chose was quite small and so it was going to be blurred if it was enlarged.
I then had to find another larger image, which is the current background now. Also, as the image was quite bright, some of the text was difficult to read. Therefore, I darkened the image, making the font stand out. ![background darkend](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25661816/33569928-26a964b8-d923-11e7-9009-9a30120320b1.jpg) 

I managed to arrange chunks of text where I wanted, except the 'About Me' section which I can't get it to go to the center.

another issue was getting the the sections for the years of university equal height.
