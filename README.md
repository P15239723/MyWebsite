When I first started my website, which is based on a Online CV, I wanted a unique background. I thought of the London Bridge as this could represent where I am from. the first image I chose was quite small and so it was going to be blurred if it was enlarged.
I then had to find another larger image, which is the current background now. Also, as the image was quite bright, some of the text was difficult to read. Therefore, I darkened the image, making the font stand out. ![background darkend](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25661816/33569928-26a964b8-d923-11e7-9009-9a30120320b1.jpg) 

I managed to arrange chunks of text where I wanted, except the 'About Me' section which I can't get it to go to the center.

Another issue was getting the the sections for the years of university equal height.

When creating an slideshow, I chose a carousel effect witchout text. I added text so that people know the name of the places. However, everytime the image changed, the text of that image will move it self at the top of the slideshow.
Here is an example:

I solved this problem by adding the text onto the image via photoshop.
