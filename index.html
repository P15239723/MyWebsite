			Through out my life I have visited many places displayed in the slideshow.
		</p>
		<p>
			India was an amazing place and went there for my cousins wedding. I stayed there for 3 weeks and travelled many cities. I lived with my uncles and they hired drivers so travelling was really easy. Most of the time I would just explore places with my family and tried delicious food as there would be places to eat everywhere.
		</p>
		<p>
			Rome was a similar holidays to Sofia, but I found this boring as we did not do any fun activities. I also went with my sister and cousins and we just visited historical places such as, Colosseum and Roman Catholic Church and many more. The reason why I did not enjoy it as much was because the places we had to go was quite far and we had to walk it there, which was really tiring, especially in the heat.

			Sofia was a nice place to visit. I went with my sister and cousins and mainly explored the place. One thing I really enjoyed about the holiday was mountain climbing. The was an exerience as I have never done it before and it was worth it. We started from the bottom and and climbed right to the top, which was not that difficult as we went through a easy route.
		</p>
		<p>
			Dubai was my favourite holiday so far. However, I was really young when I went and can not remember some of the activities. I remember going to the Water Park which felt really nice especially in the heat. I can also remember living in a nice hotel which had an amazing fountain in the lobby and many floors with fancy elevvators.
